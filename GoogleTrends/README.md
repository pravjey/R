Usage of Google Trends (without programming)

I used Google search data on the various political parties on the night of Italian elections (prior to close of voting) to predict that Silvio Berlusconi's right wing coalition would gain the largest share of the vote. My prediction was technically correct, even if the right wing coalition did not end up forming the government.

I used Google search data to indicate that the announcement by PSA that it would manufacture a particular Vauxhall product in Luton had nothing to do with with Brexit, despite news reports, and everything to do with the distribution of interest in the product.
