R programming skills:
1. Using R to analyse a dataset of gun violence incidents in the US between 2013 and 2018, calculate the number of mass shootings based on the various definitions that are used but taking into account both deaths and injuries and both shooters and victims.
2. Demonstrating the (big) difference in the number of mass shootings when different definitions are used and visualising in a scatterplot.
3. Using statistical measures (mean, standard deviation, etc) to identify a more suitable definition proposal.
4. Identifying which states and which date mass shootings took place, according to my proposed definition.
5. K means clustering of states based on number of mass shootings (most used definition).
